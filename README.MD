### ðŸ”° /searchQueary/gm ###

1. **g modifier**: global. All matches (don't return after first match)

2. **m modifier**: multi line. Causes ^ and $ to match the begin/end of each line (not only begin/end of string)

3. **i modifier**: case insensitive

``` javascript
const myStr = "My name is tripto, my age is 21, my fav color is green";
const searchQuery = /tripto/gm; //this is the search query, here we search for "tripto"
const isPresent = searchQuery.test(myStr); //here we check , if present then true, else false

console.log(isPresent); //will return true

`````

### ðŸ”° /^searchQueary$/ ###

1. ^ means the string has to start with that string
2. $ means the string ends with that string


``` javascript
const myStr = "My name is tripto, my age is 21, my fav color is green";
const searchQuery = /^name/gm; //this is the search query, here we search for "My", charcter sensitive here
const isPresent = searchQuery.test(myStr); //here we check , if present then true, else false

console.log(isPresent); //will return false, it'll be true if it was "My"

`````

1. **[a-z]**: anything within a to z
2. **[0-9]**: any number
3. **[A-Z]**: anything within A to Z

``` javascript
const myStr = "My name is tripto, my age is 21, my fav color is green";
const searchQuery = /name is [a-z]+/gm; //this is the search query, here we search for "name is plus anything within a - z, so tripto will be also counted"
const isPresent = searchQuery.test(myStr); //here we check , if present then true, else false

`````
